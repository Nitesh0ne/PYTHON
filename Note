Session 1:

Why python ? What is python ? 

- python is general purpose , high level programming language.
- python is dynamically typed language i,e don't have to mention the data type of vaiable 

"The complete Monte python Circus"

Why is python. 
- simple and easy to learn, there is only 30+ keyword 
- Python is Freeware and opensource 
    Freeware : we do to have to pay any money to use the python
    Opensource: Source code of python is openly avalibale
- python is platform independent
-  Interpreted language
- python is portable 
- python is extensible 
    python + java = jython
- python is embedded 

* Interpreted vd Complied langauge
* anaconda python

=================================================
Session 2:

Identifiers : name given to variable , function , method , class 

Naming Convention:
- allowed character a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _  only.
- cannot start with digit.
- Identifier are case Sensitive.
- Reserved word are not allowed

* _a    = Private variables
* __a   = protected variables
* __a__ = Magic vaiables, Dunder Variables


Reserved words:  cannot use as  identifers.
 List the total keyword in python.   
    import keyword
    print(keyword.kwlist) 


Data Types : what type of the data is like integer, float , character, string but in  python we do not define the data type. That's why it is dynamically typed

- there are total 14 data types in python 
1.Integer, 2.Float, 3.Complex, 4.Boolean, 5.String, 6.Byte, 7.ByteArray, 8.Range, 9.List, 10.Tuple, 11.Set, 12.FrozenSet, 13.Dictionary, 14.None

1. Integer 
- can be represented as binary, decimal, octal or hexadecimal
    binary 0b10101 , ocatal 0o1234, decimal 243, hexadeximal 0xf45

2. Float : there is decimal number e.g 10.023 

==============================================
session 3:
3. Complex :
    complex number = in the form of (a + bj) e.g 1+2j 

4. Boolean : True, False and None is are boolean data type
    True = 1, False = 0 

5. String :  Collection of character.

Slicing  of String :


# Type Casting : converting one data type into another
Fundamental data type : int, float, complex, bool, string

# Fundamental data types vs Immutability 

- All fundamental data types are immutable. Once we create an object, we cannot perform any changes in that object. If we try to change, with those changes a new object is created
e,g 
a = 10 
print(id(a))

a =20
print(id(a))

garbage collector detroy the a =10
