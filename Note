Session 1:

Why python ? What is python ? 

- python is general purpose , high level programming language.
- python is dynamically typed language i,e don't have to mention the data type of vaiable 

"The complete Monte python Circus"

Why is python. 
- simple and easy to learn, there is only 30+ keyword 
- Python is Freeware and opensource 
    Freeware : we do to have to pay any money to use the python
    Opensource: Source code of python is openly avalibale
- python is platform independent
-  Interpreted language
- python is portable 
- python is extensible 
    python + java = jython
- python is embedded 

* Interpreted vd Complied langauge
* anaconda python

=================================================
Session 2:

Identifiers : name given to variable , function , method , class 

Naming Convention:
- allowed character a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _  only.
- cannot start with digit.
- Identifier are case Sensitive.
- Reserved word are not allowed

* _a    = Private variables
* __a   = protected variables
* __a__ = Magic vaiables, Dunder Variables


Reserved words:  cannot use as  identifers.
 List the total keyword in python.   
    import keyword
    print(keyword.kwlist) 


Data Types : what type of the data is like integer, float , character, string but in  python we do not define the data type. That's why it is dynamically typed

- there are total 14 data types in python 
1.Integer, 2.Float, 3.Complex, 4.Boolean, 5.String, 6.Byte, 7.ByteArray, 8.Range, 9.List, 10.Tuple, 11.Set, 12.FrozenSet, 13.Dictionary, 14.None

1. Integer 
- can be represented as binary, decimal, octal or hexadecimal
    binary 0b10101 , ocatal 0o1234, decimal 243, hexadeximal 0xf45

2. Float : there is decimal number e.g 10.023 

==============================================
session 3:
3. Complex :
    complex number = in the form of (a + bj) e.g 1+2j 

4. Boolean : True, False and None is are boolean data type
    True = 1, False = 0 

5. String :  Collection of character.

"""
doc 
string
"""

Slicing  of String :


# Type Casting : converting one data type into another
Fundamental data type : int, float, complex, bool, string

# Fundamental data types vs Immutability 

- All fundamental data types are immutable. Once we create an object, we cannot perform any changes in that object. If we try to change, with those changes a new object is created
e,g 
a = 10 
print(id(a))

a =20
print(id(a))

garbage collector detroy the a =10 

===========================================================
Session 4 :
Collection related datatype:
list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict, range, bytes, bytesarray

i. List =  insertion order are preserved, duplicate values are allowed, heteregenous object are allowed.
e.g list_name = [12, 10.5 "value2", 12]
    list_name = [] # empty list
someof method in list:
    append(), remove(), 

ii. Tuple : Exactly as list but immutable.
    e.g tuple_name = (1,) : , is necessary

iii. Set : Duplicate value are allowed and insertion order are not preserved

Frozenset = ther are immutable

iv. Dictionary: 
        key vlaue pair

v.  Range: sequence of number

vi. bytes : Collctionn of bytes. 

e.g b = [10,20,30,40]
by = bytes[b]
print  (type(by))

===============================================
Session 5:

Escape Sequensce

>  there is no provision of constant variable in python . but in python there a practice of  making constant  variable by representating variable by Capital letter.

MAX_VALUE = 10 // constant variable

Operator in python
1. Arithmetic Operator 
2. Relational Operator / Comparison Operator
3. Logical Operator 
4. Bitwise Operator
5. Assignment Operator
6. Equality Operator 
7. Shift Operator 
8. Ternary Operator
9. Special Operator 
    i. Identity Operator 
    ii. Membership Operator

1. Arithmetic Operator:
2. Reltional Operator:
    ord("A") : print the ascii value of A 
    
    Chainig of Relational Operator:  
    e.g 10<20<30<40<50 

3. Logical Operator :  and or  not 
 if x is true then y : result x
 if x is false then y : result y 


 4. Bitwise Operator: 
    

6. Equality Operator: == , !=

7. Ternary Operator / conditional Operator :
    syntax: x = first value if condition else second value:
    e,g a = 

8. Special Operator: 
    i. Identity Operator: 
        a. is 
        b. is not 
        both are used for address comparison of variable 

        is and == 
        is check the address of variable while == check the value of variable.

    ii. Membership Operator:
        a. in 
        b. not in

Session 7: 

Python Input

> List Comprehensive 
> Unpacking Of List
> eval function
> Command line Argument
# NOTE : IN COMMAND LINE ARGUMENT ALWAYS USE DOUBLE QUOTATION FOR STRING

argeparse

python outpur statement 
> string concatenation and string repetition

 sep="|" : seperator

===========================================================
Session 8 
Flow Control In python
    in python flow control of code is managed by indentation

1. conditional Statement 
    if, if-elif , if-elif-else, if-elif
    switch
2. Iterative statement /Loop
    for and while 
3. Transfer Statement
     break and continue

1. Conditionsal statement
    i. if <condition>:
             code
    ii. if <condition>:
            if condition is true
        else:
            if condition is false
    iii. if <condition 1>:
            if condition1 is true
        elif <condition 2>: 
            if condition 2 is true
        else:
            if all avobe condition is false
iv Switch statement

sub = input("Enter  a fav sub of Engineering :")

# # match sub:
# #     case "DSA":
# #         print("")
# #     case "MAth":
# #         print("")
# #     case _:
# #         print("no subject")

==================================================
Session 9:
Iterative Statement(Loop)

1. FOR LOOP  (used when the no of iteration is fixed and wll  known)

syntax: for x in sequence:
            code

2. While LOop(Loop run until the condition is true )

3. Loop with else block (else will run when loop is executed)
for x in sequence:

else
    
# Transefer Statement
1. break : brak the loop 
2. continue : skip the loop
3. pass 
4. del statement : used to delete the refrence , does not delete the object
5. None 
6. difference between None and del
    None : 
    del  :

assignment : 
WAP to print prime number , string number , palindrome number, oerfect number , armstring number, fibonacci number, hasrshad (niven) number, twin number , trianglur number,

==========================================================
Session 10:
String :
Enclose with '' , double "" , or triple '''''',
triple '''df''' = it is called doc strign


Accessing the characters of a string:
    indexing and slicing

string repetation :
sstring concatenation:
