---------------------------------------
Python is Programming Language.
- python is interpretor while c or c++ is compiler
- 
python is not a compiler language.
python is interepreted language = not require compiler like java & C++

---------- Data types in python ---------------

type() => print the data type of variable 

## print all the inbuilt keyword of python
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)

sep= space separator
end = end line space



Number System 

Decimal = 0 to 9
binary = 0 and 1
Octal = 0 to 7 
hexadecimal = 0 - 9 ABCDEF 

--------------------------------------------

=  : is assignment operator
== : is comparison operator

Conditional Statement
1. one condition 
if condition:
	body
2. two condition 
if condition:
	body
else:
	body

3. more than two condition
if condition:
	body
elif condition:
	body 
elif  condition:
	body
else:
	body
--------------------------------------------------
Iterative statement (Loop)

1. For Loop
for  i in range():
	body
	
2. While Loop
	



--------------------------------------------
List, Set, Tuple, Dictionary

collection of data 

List = 
syntax 
l1 = [1,"Nitesh",1.2,213]



TUPLE 

in tuple data are fixed we cannot change the data


Syntax :
t1 = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
